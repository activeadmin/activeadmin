          The <strong>administration framework</strong> for business critical <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Active Admin is a Ruby on Rails plugin for generating administration style interfaces. It abstracts common business application patterns to make it simple for developers to implement beautiful and elegant interfaces with very little effort.
        </p>

        <h2>
          A beautiful interface designed for real people.

              Index Styles
            </h3>

            <p>
              Index screens are available in many styles. The default, shown here, is a table view, but Active Admin also supports Grids, Blocks and a Blog view.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <span class="caps">API</span> &amp; Downloads
            </h3>

            <p>
              Each resource that is registered with Active Admin becomes available as <span class="caps">JSON</span>, <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">CSV</span> download. Customize the output to meet your requirements.

              User Authentication
            </h3>

            <h3>
              Filters
            </h3>

            <p>
              Allow users to filter resources by searching strings, text fields, dates, and numeric values.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Sidebar Sections

        <p>
          Active Admin’s interface was designed from the ground up for non-technical users. It makes it easy for developers to build highly usable interfaces that customers will actually enjoy using.

        <p>
          Active Admin and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are
          working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that
          covers all of the open source you use.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want the flexibility of open source and the confidence of

          The Tidelift Subscription manages your dependencies for you.
        </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Get the tools you need to continuously catalog and understand the open source software that your application depends on.
          </li>

          <li>
            Your subscription helps pay the open source maintainers of the exact
            packages you use to ensure they meet the standards you require.
          </li>

          <li>
            Address issues proactively, with tools that scan for new security,
            licensing, and maintenance issues, and alert our participating open
            source maintainers so they can resolve them on your behalf.
          </li>

          <li>
            Measure and improve your open source dependencies' health—which
            improves your app’s health—and get a short list of high-impact steps
            your team can take to improve them even more.
          </li>

          <li>
            Get commercial assurances that don't come for free with open source
            packages, like intellectual property indemnification and support
            under a service level agreement. You expect these guarantees from
            proprietary software, and you can have them when using open source
            as well.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from
          commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open source you
          use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open source trivia,
          and more time building your own applications—and your business.
