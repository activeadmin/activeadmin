# Index as a Grid

Sometimes you want to display the index screen for a set of resources as a grid
(possibly a grid of thumbnail images). To do so, use the :grid option for the
index block.

```ruby
index as: :grid do |product|
  link_to image_tag(product.image_path), admin_product_path(product)
end
```

The block is rendered within a cell in the grid once for each resource in the
collection. The resource is passed into the block for you to use in the view.

You can customize the number of columns that are rendered using the columns
option:

```ruby
index as: :grid, columns: 5 do |product|
  link_to image_tag(product.image_path), admin_product_path(product)
end
```
