<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below. We're a small team
and without detailed information it's not possible for us to help and your bug
report will be closed. -->

Describe your issue with a **clear title and description**. Make sure to include
as much relevant information as possible, including a code sample or failing
test that demonstrates the expected behavior, as well as your system
configuration. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself - and others -
to reproduce the bug and figure out a fix.

### Expected behavior

What do you think should happen?

### Actual behavior

What actually happens?

### How to reproduce

Having a way to reproduce your issue will help people confirm, investigate,
and ultimately fix your issue. You can do this by providing an executable test
case. To make this process easier, please use [our bug report template script].

Copy the content of the appropriate template into an `.rb` file and make the
necessary changes to demonstrate the issue. You can execute it by running
`ruby the_file.rb` in your terminal. If all goes well, you should see your test
case failing.
