    #        that the user is currently on. Note, we may be authorizing access
    #        to a different subject, so don't rely on this other than to
    #        pull configuration information from.
    #
    # @param [any] user The current user. The user is set to whatever is returned
    #        from `#current_active_admin_user` in the controller.

    # Returns true of false depending on if the user is authorized to perform
    # the action on the subject.

    # @param [Symbol] action The name of the action to perform. Usually this will be
    #        one of the `ActiveAdmin::Auth::*` symbols.
    #
    # @param [any] subject The subject the action is being performed on usually this
    #        is a model object. Note, that this is NOT always in instance, it can be
    #        the class of the subject also. For example, Active Admin uses the class
    #        of the resource to decide if the resource should be displayed in the
    #        global navigation. To deal with this nicely in a case statement, take
    #        a look at `#normalized(klass)`

    # @param [ActiveRecord::Relation] collection The collection the user is
    #        attempting to view.
    #
    # @param [Symbol] action The name of the action to perform. Usually this will be
    #        one of the `ActiveAdmin::Auth::*` symbols. Defaults to `Auth::READ` if
    #        no action passed in.

    # The `#authorized?` method's subject can be set to both instances as well
    # as classes of objects. This can make it much difficult to create simple
    # case statements for authorization since you have to handle both the
    # class level match and the instance level match.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #     class MyAuthAdapter < ActiveAdmin::AuthorizationAdapter
    #
    #       def authorized?(action, subject = nil)
    #         case subject
    #         when Post
    #           true
    #         when Class
    #           if subject == Post
    #             true
    #           end
    #         end
    #       end
    #
    #     end
    #
    # To handle this, the normalized method takes care of returning a object
    # which implements `===` to be matched in a case statement.
    #
    # The above now becomes:
    #
    #     class MyAuthAdapter < ActiveAdmin::AuthorizationAdapter
    #
    #       def authorized?(action, subject = nil)
    #         case subject
    #         when normalized(Post)
    #           true
    #         end
    #       end
    #
    #     end
