          tabs do
            tab :overview do
              span "tab 1"

    And I am logged in
    And I am on the post's show page

    Then I should see tabs:
    | Tab title |
    | Overview  |
    | ãƒ†ã‚¹ãƒˆ     |
    | ðŸ¤—        |
    And I should see tab content "tab 1"
    And I should not see tab content "tab 2"
    And I should not see tab content "tab 3"

    When I follow "ãƒ†ã‚¹ãƒˆ"
    Then I should not see tab content "tab 1"
    And I should see tab content "tab 2"
    And I should not see tab content "tab 3"

    When I follow "ðŸ¤—"
    Then I should not see tab content "tab 1"
    And I should not see tab content "tab 2"
    And I should see tab content "tab 3"
