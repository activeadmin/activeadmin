  Background:
    Given I am logged in
    And 1 post exists
    And a configuration of:
    """
    require 'cancan'

    class ::Ability
      include ::CanCan::Ability

    And I am on the index page for posts

  Scenario: Attempt to access a resource I am not authorized to see
    When I go to the last post's edit page
    Then I should see "You are not authorized to perform this action"

  Scenario: Viewing the default action items
    When I follow "View"
    Then I should not see an action item link to "Edit"

  Scenario: Attempting to visit a Page without authorization
    When I go to the admin no access page
    Then I should see "You are not authorized to perform this action"

  Scenario: Viewing a page with authorization
    When I go to the admin dashboard page
    Then I should see "Dashboard"
