== Getting Started

Active Admin is released as a Ruby Gem. The gem is to be installed within a Ruby
on Rails 3 application. To install, simply add the following to your Gemfile:

  gem 'activeadmin'

After updating your bundle, run the installer

  $> rails generate active_admin:install

The installer creates an initializer used for configuring defaults used by Active Admin as well
as a new folder at <tt>app/admin</tt> to put all your admin configurations.

Migrate your db and start the server:

  $> rake db:migrate
  $> rails server

Visit http://localhost:3000/admin and log in using:

* *User*: admin@example.com
* *Password*: password

Voila! You're on your brand new Active Admin dashboard.

To register your first model, run:

  $> rails generate active_admin:resource [MyModelName]

This creates a file at <tt>app/admin/my_model_names.rb</tt> for configuring the resource.
Refresh your web browser to see the interface.

== Upgrading

When upgrading to a new version of ActiveAdmin you may need to run
  $> rails generate active_admin:assets

If you get:
  uninitialized constant Admin::DashboardController
when trying to view the dashboard (at +/admin+), ensure +app/admin/dashboards.rb+ looks like the current {default}[https://raw.github.com/gregbell/active_admin/master/lib/generators/active_admin/install/templates/dashboard.rb].

== Tools Being Used

We believe strongly in not writing code unless we have to, so Active Admin is built using many
other open source projects:

InheritedResources::
  Inherited Resources speeds up development by making your controllers inherit all restful
  actions so you just have to focus on what is important.
Formtastic::
  A DSL for semantically building amazing forms.
Devise::
  User authentication is done using Devise
Kaminari::
  Pagination for rails apps
Iconic Icons::
  Excellent SVG icon set designed by P.J. Onori: http://somerandomdude.com/projects/iconic
