### Deprecations

* `ActiveAdmin::Event` (`ActiveAdmin::EventDispatcher`). [#3435] by [@timoschilling]
  `ActiveAdmin::Event` will be removed in a future version, ActiveAdmin switched
  to use `ActiveSupport::Notifications`
  NOTE: The blog parameters has changed:

  ```ruby
  ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe ActiveAdmin::Application::BeforeLoadEvent do |event, *args|
    # some code
  end

  ActiveSupport::Notifications.publish ActiveAdmin::Application::BeforeLoadEvent, "some data"
  ```

* `action_item` without a name, to introduce a solution for removing action items (`remove_action_item(name)`). [#3091] by [@amiel]
